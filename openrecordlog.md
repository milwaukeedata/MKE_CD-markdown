MKE Community Database - DATASET OPEN RECORD COMMUNICATION LOG
=============

This is a simple guide/outline for how to post a content and an open records communication log on GitHub or the [Milwaukee Community Database](http://mkecommunitydata.com) that will let people know what the communication history is for your open records requests.

Rules to follow:

0. This format will help others scrape this content effectively. Please follow the guideline!
0. The number of hashes in front of a line will indicate the level of information. DO NOT CHANGE THESE. It makes it easier for others to scrape from the web site.
0. The first line of each note should be the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, and should have three hashes "###" in front of it.
0. It is important that there is a space between each line that is not a list. 
0. The line with Method and From should always be the same format: "FROM: personsNameHere - personsOrganization", then next line, "TO: personsName - organizationName", then next line, "VIA: email (or phone)", without the quotes.
0. Always put the text in between the grave accents "`" as indicated below, so the text is sandwiched between the pair.
0. For any attachments, put the text you want to link in the brackets "[]" and the URL/web link in the parenthesis "()"
0. Always leave one empty line in between the FROM, TO, VIA, text and ATTACHMENTS lines.

Oh, and thank you for submitting your open records request, sharing it with the Community Database and posting your log online!
