MKE Community Database - DATASET & RESOURCE Introduction
=============

This is a simple guide/outline for how to introduce a dataset or a data resource on the [Milwaukee Community Database](http://mkecommunitydata.com) that will make it easier for people to know what the data is, how to use it and how it was obtained. 

Rules to follow:

0. This format will help others scrape this content effectively. Please follow the guideline!
0. The number of hashes in front of a line will indicate the level of information. DO NOT CHANGE THESE. It makes it easier for others to scrape from the web site.
0. It is important that there is a space between each line that is not a list. 
0. Always put the text in between the grave accents "`" as indicated below, so the text is sandwiched between the pair.
0. For any attachments, put the text you want to link in the brackets "[]" and the URL/web link in the parenthesis "()"

Oh, and thank you for submitting your open records request, sharing it with the Community Database and posting your log online!
